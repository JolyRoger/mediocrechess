Hi chess player!

If you want to play with Mediocre try [Chigorin](https://github.com/JolyRoger/Chigorin). There you can select this engine and fight with it. This application is writen when I was learning Play framework, and it works not so good as I expected.

This is the chess web application based on Mediocre chess engine by Jonatan Peterson and Play web framework. Here you can play chess, save current game into XML on your computer and load it from there. Also you can take bad move back and look at previous moves.

You can clone this project, go to its directory and type *sbt* and *run*. It will be built after that you can open http://localhost:9000 in your favourite browser.
